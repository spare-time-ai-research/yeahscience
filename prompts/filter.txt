Example of a resulting JSON object:

```
{
    "entries": [
        {"link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.001001", "title": "Large language models: a survey of approaches", "topic": "Large Language Models"},
        {"link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.001002", "title": "Novel neural network architecture", "topic": "Neural Network Architecture"}
    ]
}
```

Do your best to accomplish your task. My career depends on it.
