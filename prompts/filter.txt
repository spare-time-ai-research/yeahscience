Here is a JSON list of RSS feed entries in JSON format, every entry contains title, description and link:

###

{{entries}}

###

Based on entry titles and descriptions, filter them to only include results that are related to these topics:
* Retrieval Augmented Generation
* Agent Systems
* Neural Network Architecture
* Natural Language Processing
* Artificial General Intelligence
* Artificial Intelligence Security
* Artificial Consciousness

Make sure you are 100% confident in the topic, otherwise skip the entry.
Skip entries not related to topics I am not interested in or having an empty description.

Return a JSON object with 'entries' attribute, containing a list of relevant entries.
Every entry should contain a link, a title and a topic it relates to. Retain link and title from the original list of
entries, you are only allowed to set the topic for each entry.

Example of a resulting JSON object:

###

{
    "entries": [
        {"link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.001001", "title": "Large language models: a survey of approaches", "topic": "Large Language Models"},
        {"link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.001002", "title": "Novel neural network architecture", "topic": "Neural Network Architecture"}
    ]
}

Do your best to accomplish your task. My career depends on it.
