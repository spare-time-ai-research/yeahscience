Here is a description of a blog post or a research paper:

{{description}}

Create a summary of this description, having the following properties:
* Make it 3 sentences at most
* The summary should be brief and to the point
* Use very clear language, I don't want to have to think about what you are saying
* It should be a summary of the content, not a description of the content

Return a JSON object with 'summary' attribute, containing a summary. Example:

```
{
    "summary": "This is a summary of the content"
}
```
